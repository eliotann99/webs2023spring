                <p>Throughout my academic and personal endeavors, I've had the opportunity to work on a 
                    variety of interesting projects, including concept maps, UI designs, GUI development using Java,
                    text adventure games, audio projects, video editing, and many more. These experiences have helped me
                    develop diverse skill set and a passion for innovation and experimentation.

                <p>I have been working on a desktop UI design for my capstone project, which aims to redesign open source editing tools to make them
                    more accessible and to incorporate integrated design between them. The project is still in progress, but you can view one of the prototypes
                    by clicking the link above.

                <p>In my spare time, I have undertaken the development of a food recipe app concept, with a focus on designing for mobile devices. Through this project,
                    I have gained valuable experience in addressing the unique challenges of mobile UI design, and have further honed my skills as a UI/UX designer. 
                    While the project is still ongoing, you may view a prototype of the app by following the link provided above

                <p>I have had the opportunity to work on various audio projects, during which I utilized a professional-grade audio kit to capture sounds and edited 
                    them using Adobe Audition.

                <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in video editing by working on various projects for school. I am currently exploring ways to efficiently
                    include these videos on my website without affecting page load times. Additionally, I have developed a strong sense of design for presentations, creating engaging
                    visuals and clear messaging for multiple classes and events. I am also continually improving my communication and writing skills, having recently completed a 
                    public speaking course.</p>
