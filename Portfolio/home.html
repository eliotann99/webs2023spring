            <p class="about">My name is Elio Tannous and I'm a senior student at the University of Pittsburgh!
                I'm studying Digital Narrative &amp; Interactive Design (DNID) and minoring in Computer Science.
                I look forward to applying the differrent skill sets that I have acquired over the years in the
                work field after graduation. Overtime, I've had many  peopple describe me as confident, friendly,
                and reliable.
            </p><br>
            <p>Currently, I live in south Oakland as I go to school. However, I come thirty minutes north of
                Pittsburgh. I worked as an Aldi crew member throughout most of my college years. This experience
                has helped me fine tune my customer service skills.
            </p><br>
            <p>Often times, I tend to show interest in more hobbies than I can keep up with. However, jumping rorpe,
                playing pickle ball, watching moves, and hanging out with freinds are some of the interests that
                stuck with me over the years.
