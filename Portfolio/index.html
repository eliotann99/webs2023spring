            <img class="portrait" src="../images/portrait.jpg" alt="Picture of me">
            <p>I am Elio Tannous, a senior student at the University of Pittsburgh pursuing a degree 
                in Digital Narrative &amp; Interactive Design (DNID) with a minor in Computer Science. As I approach graduation,
                I am eager to apply my diverse skill set in the professional world.
            </p><br>
            <p>I am originally from Gibsonia, located 30 minutes north of Pittsburgh, but currently reside in South Oakland while 
                attending school at the University of Pittsburgh. I worked as an Aldi crew member throughout most of my college years. 
                This experience has helped me fine tune my customer service skills.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                In addition to my academic pursuits, I maintain a variety of hobbies, including jumping rope, playing pickleball, watching 
                movies, and spending time with friends. I am often described as confident, friendly, and reliable, and I am passionate about 
                exploring new interests and experiences.
